maybe a solution is always possible

maybe a * b + a = something
this solution may be wrong if either a or b are divisible by one another though.

let's try sample input output
5, 3 
15 + 5 = 20

think of something which may violate this rule...
6, 3
18 3 21

the intution was slightly incorrect
I thought if a is divisible by a but the correct condition was if b == 1 then no solution exists.
