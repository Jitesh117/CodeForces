i'm thinking of a greedy solution(tbh I looked at the tags)
take the longest substring of equal characters, then delete the substring while the string is not empty

although I came up with this idea but I'm still thinking how to find the longest substring

maybe I should make a function for this. but is there any better way to do this?
